Assignment #1

Libraries used:
    iostream
    string
    stack
    vector

Header files(.h):
    functions.h - definitions of the node and tree classes. It also contains non-member function declarations.

Implementation files(.cpp):
    functions.cpp
    run.cpp

Abilities of code:
    Able to handle negative integers in input

Format of input string:
    As specified in the assignment pdf, the input expression contains only the arithmetic operators +, *, - and /,
    integers and (, ) if the expression is in infix form. * and / have more priority than + and -. You should
    leave at least 1 space between operators, operands and symbols (the minus sign(“-”) for negative numbers
    should however be attached to the number, -23 for instance).
    Sample input example: ( 4 + 8 ) * ( 6 - 5 ) / ( 3 - 2 ) * ( 2 + 2 )
